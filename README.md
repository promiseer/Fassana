## Introduction

In a fast-paced world where project management is crucial, our Project Management Tickets System aims to provide a user-friendly and effective platform for organizing, tracking, and managing tasks and projects. Whether you are a developer, manager, or a team lead, this system will help you streamline your workflow and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.

## Features

Our Project Management Tickets System comes with a variety of features to help you stay on top of your projects:

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system.
- **Project Management**: Create, edit, and delete projects with details and deadlines.
- **Ticket Creation**: Create tickets, assign them to team members, and set priority.
- **Task Tracking**: Track the progress of tasks, update their status, and add comments.
- **Search and Filtering**: Easily find projects and tickets based on various criteria.
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications for updates and mentions.
- **User Roles**: Define different roles for team members, e.g., admins, developers, and managers.

## Tech Stack

Our system is built using modern technologies for both the frontend and backend:

- **Frontend**: The user interface is developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a popular React framework known for its speed and developer experience.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic is powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), making it robust and scalable.
- **Database**: We are using a non-relational database [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store project and ticket data.
- **Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication with libraries like [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/).
- **Websockets**: For real-time updates and notifications, we leverage libraries like [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).

Thank you for choosing the Project Management Tickets System! We hope it proves to be a valuable tool for your project management needs. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us. Happy managing!


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
